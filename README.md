## Peregrine is a free network tool.

We are working on iOS recently, the first version will support [Vmess](https://v2ray.com/chapter_02/protocols/vmess.html), but the goal is support most popular protocols such as [SS](https://github.com/shadowsocks) [SSR]() [TROJAN](https://trojan-gfw.github.io/trojan/protocol) etc, When iOS get a stable version, we will provide a MacOS version too.
